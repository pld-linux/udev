# for where it looks for files, and where it places device nodes.

# WARNING: changing any value, can cause serious system breakage!

# udev_root - where in the filesystem to place the device nodes
udev_root="/dev/"

# udev_db - The name and location of the udev database.
udev_db="/dev/.udevdb"

# udev_rules - The name and location of the udev rules file

# Initial hotplug synthesizing method. Possible values:
# udevstart (default) or udevsynthesize (new).
# 
# udevsynthesize gets all available devices from sysfs and synthesizes the
# events these devices would have generated at creation time.
# The events are directly passed to the udevd daemom socket. udevd does all the
# work and runs all the events asynchronously. udevsynthesize itself does
# not read any udev rule.
#
# It scans block and class devices to create the the device nodes for already
# available devices, which obsoletes the run of udevstart.
#
# After that, it scans for bus devices, which events may load modules or
# configure the device. If the bus type is known, the usual bus-specific
# values are added to the event environment.

UDEV_STARTER="udevstart"
